Access to sensitive and valuable information necessitates complex and secure methods to verify users and authorize what data and applications they are allowed to access. [Ego](https://www.overture.bio/products/ego/)  simplifies user management by providing a secure system to authenticate and authorize users of your application. [Ego](https://www.overture.bio/products/ego/) uses well-known single-sign-on identity providers like Google, GitHub, LinkedIn and ORCiD in place of managing usernames and passwords. 

Ego is [OAuth 2.0](https://oauth.net/2/) and [OpenID Connect](https://auth0.com/docs/authenticate/protocols/openid-connect-protocol) compliant. It is written in JAVA and uses [Sprint Boot](https://spring.io/projects/spring-boot) and [Spring Security Frameworks](https://spring.io/projects/spring-security). Because it uses [JSON Web Tokens (JWT)](https://jwt.io/) for stateless authorization, it can scale to accommodate many users. See our thorough [documentation](https://www.overture.bio/documentation/ego/) for further details.
